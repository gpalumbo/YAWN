# Project State and Claude Session Rules

## ðŸ”„ IMPORTANT SESSION START PROTOCOL
**When reading CLAUDE.md, always immediately read these companion files:**
1. **CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md** - Development workflows, testing procedures, and coding standards
2. **PROJECT_SPEC.md** - Project architecture, technology stack, and feature requirements
3. **INDEX.md** - Code navigation, file structure, and implementation reference

This ensures complete context for the current session and maintains consistency across all development work.

## Current Project State

### Completed Components
- âœ… **Chrome Extension Production-Ready** (2024-09-22)
    - Location: `chrome-extension/`
    - Features: Context menu integration, popup interface, local storage, security hardening
    - Status: Complete with security fixes, PR #3 (`feature/security-and-error-handling-fixes`)
    - Manual testing: Fully functional with comprehensive error handling
    - Documentation: Complete with INDEX.md for code navigation

### Architecture Foundation
- âœ… Project specification defined (PROJECT_SPEC.md)
- âœ… Git workflow and standards established
- âœ… Chrome extension manifest v3 structure
- ðŸ”„ Backend API not started
- ðŸ”„ Database schema not implemented
- ðŸ”„ Cloud deployment not configured

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Chrome Extension**: Manifest v3, SVG icons, service worker + popup architecture
- **Permissions**: activeTab, storage, scripting, contextMenus
- **Security**: Content Security Policy, XSS prevention, comprehensive error handling
- **UX**: Context menu integration, user-friendly error messages
- **Styling**: Gradient theme matching project branding
- **Storage**: Chrome local storage with usage analytics
- **Documentation**: INDEX.md for comprehensive code navigation

### Remaining Technical Debt
- No automated tests for extension (manual testing only)
- Icons are basic SVG placeholders (functional but could be improved)
- No build process or bundling (not needed for current scope)
- ~~Code duplication between background.js and popup.js~~ âœ… **RESOLVED** - Created shared-utils.js

## Latest Session Summary (2024-09-23)

### Major Accomplishments - Session 1
1. **Documentation Refactoring** - Reorganized docs with clear separation of concerns (CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md, PROJECT_SPEC.md, INDEX.md)
2. **JavaScript/HTML Formatting** - Added comprehensive Prettier and ESLint configuration
3. **DevOps Integration** - Updated pre-commit hooks and Makefile for full-stack linting/formatting
4. **Source Control Management** - Proper .gitignore rules for node_modules/ and JavaScript artifacts
5. **Cross-Platform Tooling** - Consistent formatting/linting for both Python and JavaScript codebases
6. **Console-Friendly Linting** - ESLint configured to ignore console statements as requested

### Major Accomplishments - Session 2 (Continued)
1. **Note Creation System** - Complete implementation of persistent note functionality with DOM anchoring
2. **Coordinate Capture Fix** - Solved critical positioning bug where notes appeared at (100,100) instead of click location
3. **Hybrid Selector Strategy** - Implemented CSS + XPath hybrid approach for maximum DOM element detection reliability
4. **Memory Leak Resolution** - Fixed critical setInterval accumulation issue in content script
5. **Code Architecture Improvement** - Created shared-utils.js eliminating code duplication across extension files
6. **Error Handling Enhancement** - Added comprehensive validation and race condition protection

### Technical Implementation Details - Session 2
- **DOM Anchoring System**: Notes anchor to specific DOM elements using CSS selectors and XPath
- **Coordinate Capture**: Custom contextmenu event listener captures exact right-click coordinates
- **Progressive Fallback**: CSS selector â†’ XPath â†’ absolute coordinates fallback strategy
- **Storage Schema**: Notes organized by URL with metadata including creation time and positioning
- **Memory Management**: Proper interval cleanup and beforeunload event handling
- **Race Condition Protection**: Ongoing injection tracking prevents duplicate operations
- **Selector Validation**: Cross-validation between CSS and XPath ensures element uniqueness
