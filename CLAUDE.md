# Project State and Claude Session Rules

## ðŸ”„ IMPORTANT SESSION START PROTOCOL
**When reading CLAUDE.md, always immediately read these companion files:**
1. **CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md** - Development workflows, testing procedures, and coding standards
2. **PROJECT_SPEC.md** - Project architecture, technology stack, and feature requirements
3. **INDEX.md** - Code navigation, file structure, and implementation reference

This ensures complete context for the current session and maintains consistency across all development work.

## Current Project State

### Completed Components
- âœ… **Chrome Extension Production-Ready** (2024-09-22)
    - Location: `chrome-extension/`
    - Features: Context menu integration, popup interface, local storage, security hardening
    - Status: Complete with security fixes, PR #3 (`feature/security-and-error-handling-fixes`)
    - Manual testing: Fully functional with comprehensive error handling
    - Documentation: Complete with INDEX.md for code navigation

### Architecture Foundation
- âœ… Project specification defined (PROJECT_SPEC.md)
- âœ… Git workflow and standards established
- âœ… Chrome extension manifest v3 structure
- ðŸ”„ Backend API not started
- ðŸ”„ Database schema not implemented
- ðŸ”„ Cloud deployment not configured

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Chrome Extension**: Manifest v3, SVG icons, service worker + popup architecture
- **Permissions**: activeTab, storage, scripting, contextMenus
- **Security**: Content Security Policy, XSS prevention, comprehensive error handling
- **UX**: Context menu integration, user-friendly error messages
- **Styling**: Gradient theme matching project branding
- **Storage**: Chrome local storage with usage analytics
- **Documentation**: INDEX.md for comprehensive code navigation

### Remaining Technical Debt
- No automated tests for extension (manual testing only)
- Icons are basic SVG placeholders (functional but could be improved)
- No build process or bundling (not needed for current scope)
- Code duplication between background.js and popup.js (noted in INDEX.md)

## Latest Session Summary (2024-09-22)

### Major Accomplishments
1. **Context Menu Integration** - Replaced auto-banner with right-click context menu
2. **Security Hardening** - Eliminated all XSS vulnerabilities, added CSP
3. **Production Error Handling** - Comprehensive try-catch, Chrome API error checking
4. **Code Review Integration** - Addressed all valid Copilot feedback
5. **Documentation** - Created comprehensive INDEX.md for code navigation
6. **Pull Request Management** - PR #2 (context menu) and PR #3 (security fixes)

### Key Files Modified
- `chrome-extension/background.js` - Complete rewrite with security and error handling
- `chrome-extension/popup.js` - Security fixes and improved error handling
- `chrome-extension/manifest.json` - Added CSP and contextMenus permission
- `chrome-extension/README.md` - Updated with context menu testing instructions
- `INDEX.md` - New comprehensive code navigation document

### Security Improvements
- âœ… Eliminated all innerHTML usage (XSS prevention)
- âœ… Added Content Security Policy
- âœ… Implemented tab validation for restricted URLs
- âœ… Added script injection timeout protection
- âœ… Comprehensive input validation and error handling

### Performance Optimizations
- âœ… Fixed race conditions in storage operations

- âœ… Added timeout protection for hanging operations
- âœ… Optimized DOM manipulation with safe methods

### Code Quality
- âœ… Added JSDoc documentation throughout
- âœ… Implemented proper async/await patterns
- âœ… Created reusable utility functions
- âœ… Added constants for magic numbers
- âœ… Improved error logging with context

## Session Rules and Permissions

### Permission Required For
- Deleting or modifying existing tests
- Changing database schema after MVP
- Modifying API contracts
- Removing existing functionality
- Major dependency updates
- Changing architecture from PROJECT_SPEC.md
- Modifying Chrome extension permissions in manifest.json
- Adding new Chrome extension APIs or permissions

### Always Do Without Asking
- Add new tests
- Fix obvious typos
- Add error handling
- Improve logging
- Add type hints
- Write docstrings
- Create feature branches
- Update Chrome extension UI/styling
- Add new extension features that don't require new permissions

### Session Goals

#### Previous Session Goal
Create hello world Chrome extension, install and manually test

#### Current Session Goal
Add context menu functionality, fix security issues, create comprehensive documentation

#### Next Session Should
- Begin implementing actual notes functionality (note creation, DOM anchoring)
- Set up backend API structure according to PROJECT_SPEC.md
- Create database schema with temporal versioning
- Consider adding automated testing framework

## Session End Checklist

Before ending any development session:
- All code committed with proper messages
- Tests written and passing
- PR created if feature complete
- CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md updated with current state
- Next steps documented
