# Project State and Claude Session Rules

## ðŸ”„ IMPORTANT SESSION START PROTOCOL
**When reading CLAUDE.md, always immediately read these companion files:**
1. **CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md** - Development workflows, testing procedures, and coding standards
2. **PROJECT_SPEC.md** - Project architecture, technology stack, and feature requirements
3. **INDEX.md** - Code navigation, file structure, and implementation reference

This ensures complete context for the current session and maintains consistency across all development work.

## Current Project State

### Completed Components
- âœ… **Chrome Extension with Markdown Editing** (2024-09-24)
    - Location: `chrome-extension/`
    - Features: Context menu integration, popup interface, note creation/editing, drag-and-drop, markdown support, XSS protection
    - Status: Complete with markdown editing system, PR #8 (`feat: implement comprehensive markdown note editing with migration system`)
    - Manual testing: Full editing workflow tested - creation, editing, auto-save, migration
    - Documentation: Complete with comprehensive code navigation

### Architecture Foundation
- âœ… Project specification defined (PROJECT_SPEC.md)
- âœ… Git workflow and standards established
- âœ… Chrome extension manifest v3 structure
- ðŸ”„ Backend API not started
- ðŸ”„ Database schema not implemented
- ðŸ”„ Cloud deployment not configured

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Chrome Extension**: Manifest v3, SVG icons, service worker + popup architecture
- **Permissions**: activeTab, storage, scripting, contextMenus
- **Security**: Content Security Policy, XSS prevention with DOMPurify, comprehensive error handling
- **Markdown**: marked.js for parsing with custom security renderer, auto-detection of markdown content
- **Editing**: In-place double-click editing with textarea overlay, auto-save with debouncing
- **Storage**: Chrome local storage with backward-compatible migration system (text â†’ content field)
- **UX**: Context menu integration, drag-and-drop notes, visual editing feedback, keyboard shortcuts
- **Styling**: Gradient theme matching project branding
- **Documentation**: INDEX.md for comprehensive code navigation

### Remaining Technical Debt
- No automated tests for extension (manual testing only)
- Icons are basic SVG placeholders (functional but could be improved)
- No build process or bundling (not needed for current scope)
- ~~Code duplication between background.js and popup.js~~ âœ… **RESOLVED** - Created shared-utils.js

## Latest Session Summary (2025-01-24) - Enhanced URL Matching & Drag-Edit Improvements

### Major Accomplishments - Session 5
1. **Enhanced URL Matching System** - Implemented URL normalization that ignores anchor fragments (#) while preserving query parameters for better note visibility across page navigation
2. **Drag-Edit Interaction Improvements** - Resolved conflicts between drag operations and text editing by disabling drag during edit mode
3. **Backward-Compatible Migration** - Created automatic migration system for existing notes to work with enhanced URL matching
4. **Production-Ready PR** - Created and updated PR #9 with comprehensive feedback resolution and testing plan

### Technical Implementation Highlights - Session 5
- **URL Normalization**: Smart URL processing that strips anchors but preserves query parameters for dynamic page functionality
- **Cross-Anchor Visibility**: Notes created on `example.com/page` now appear on `example.com/page#section1` and `example.com/page#section2`
- **Drag Prevention Logic**: Dynamic cursor management and event handling prevents drag interference during text editing
- **Migration System**: Automatic consolidation of URL variations with cleanup to prevent storage bloat
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms and input validation throughout

### Critical Issues Resolved - Session 5
- **URL Fragment Navigation**: Fixed notes disappearing when users navigate using anchor links within pages
- **Drag-Edit Conflicts**: Resolved interference between drag operations and text selection during note editing
- **PR Code Quality**: Addressed all Copilot feedback including unreachable code, documentation clarity, and migration explanations
- **Storage Optimization**: Implemented deduplication and cleanup logic for efficient note storage
- **Cursor Management**: Enhanced visual feedback with proper cursor states (text/move/grabbing) based on interaction context

### Pull Request Status - Session 5
- **PR #9**: `feat(extension): enhanced URL matching and drag-edit interaction improvements`
- **Status**: Ready for review/merge with all feedback addressed (6 total commits)
- **Features**: Two major UX improvements with zero breaking changes
- **Testing**: Comprehensive manual testing plan with edge cases covered

## Previous Session Summary (2024-09-24) - Markdown Editing Implementation

### Major Accomplishments - Session 4
1. **Complete Markdown Editing System** - Implemented in-place note editing with markdown support, security hardening, and XSS protection
2. **Storage Schema Migration** - Created backward-compatible migration system from legacy `text` field to modern `content` field
3. **Critical Data Flow Bug Fix** - Resolved stale data closure problem causing edit textarea to show original instead of saved content
4. **Library Integration** - Added marked.js and DOMPurify via npm with proper CSP configuration
5. **Production-Ready PR** - Created PR #8 with comprehensive markdown editing implementation

### Technical Implementation Highlights - Session 4
- **Markdown Rendering**: Secure markdown-to-HTML conversion using marked.js with custom renderer for link security
- **XSS Protection**: DOMPurify sanitization with strict allowlists for HTML tags and attributes
- **In-Place Editing**: Double-click to edit with textarea overlay, preserving drag-and-drop functionality
- **Auto-Save System**: 1-second debounced auto-save with visual feedback and keyboard shortcuts (Escape/Ctrl+Enter)
- **Migration System**: Automatic legacy note migration on first load with proper error handling
- **Data Consistency**: Fixed stale closure bug ensuring edit mode always shows most recent saved content

### Critical Issues Resolved - Session 4
- **Edit Content Bug**: Fixed critical issue where editing multiple times showed original text instead of saved content
- **Migration Logic**: Ensured migration only occurs during initial read, never during user operations
- **Stale Data Closure**: Resolved closure problem in `addEditingCapability()` and `enterEditMode()` functions
- **Library Management**: Used npm for proper dependency management instead of web downloads
- **Security Hardening**: Implemented comprehensive XSS protection and CSP compliance

### Pull Request Status - Session 4
