# Project State and Claude Session Rules

## ðŸ”„ IMPORTANT SESSION START PROTOCOL

**Optional context files** (load on-demand):
1. **CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md** - Development workflows, testing procedures, and coding standards
2. **PROJECT_SPEC.md** - Project architecture, technology stack, and feature requirements
3. **CODE_REFERENCE.md** - Code navigation, file structure, and implementation reference
4. **CLAUDE_ARCHIVE.md** - Historical session summaries and implementation details

This optimized structure reduces always-loaded context while maintaining complete development continuity.

## Current Project State

### Completed Components
- âœ… **Chrome Extension with Rich Editing & Text Selection** (Production Ready)
    - Location: `chrome-extension/`
    - Features: Context menu, popup interface, drag-and-drop notes, markdown editing, rich text toolbar, note deletion, CSS styling, text selection capture, highlighting
    - Status: Complete with comprehensive UX features and security hardening
    - PRs Merged: #7-13 (offset/drag, markdown editing, URL matching, rich toolbar/deletion/styling, text selection & highlighting)
    - Security: CSS injection prevention, XPath validation, memory management
    - Manual testing: Full editing workflow and text selection verified

### Architecture Foundation
- âœ… Project specification defined (PROJECT_SPEC.md)
- âœ… Git workflow and standards established
- âœ… Chrome extension manifest v3 structure
- ðŸ”„ Backend API (hello world only)
- ðŸ”„ Database schema not implemented
- ðŸ”„ Cloud deployment not configured

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Chrome Extension**: Manifest v3, service worker + popup architecture, local storage
- **Security**: Content Security Policy, XSS prevention with DOMPurify, comprehensive error handling
- **Markdown**: marked.js parsing with custom security renderer, auto-detection
- **Editing**: In-place editing with textarea overlay, auto-save with debouncing
- **Rich Features**: Drag-and-drop positioning, rich text toolbar, note deletion, CSS styling, text selection capture, visual highlighting
- **Storage**: Chrome local storage with backward-compatible migration system
- **Security**: CSS injection prevention, XPath validation, input sanitization, memory leak prevention

### Remaining Technical Debt
- No automated tests for extension (manual testing only)
- Icons are basic SVG placeholders
- No build process or bundling (not needed for current scope)

## Session Rules and Permissions

### Permission Required For
- Deleting or modifying existing tests
- Changing database schema after MVP
- Modifying API contracts
- Removing existing functionality
- Major dependency updates
- Changing architecture from PROJECT_SPEC.md
- Modifying Chrome extension permissions in manifest.json
- Adding new Chrome extension APIs or permissions

### Always Do Without Asking
- Add new tests
- Fix obvious typos
- Add error handling
- Improve logging
- Add type hints
- Write docstrings
- Create feature branches
- Update Chrome extension UI/styling
- Add new extension features that don't require new permissions

## Current Session Goals

### Recent Accomplishments âœ…
- Enhanced URL matching and drag-edit interaction improvements (PR #9)
- Rich text markdown toolbar implementation (PR #10)
- Note deletion and CSS styling features
- **Text selection capture and highlighting** with security hardening (PR #13)
- **Critical security fixes**: CSS injection prevention, XPath validation, memory management
- Documentation optimization and context management

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Automated testing framework** for Chrome extension
2. **Backend API development** according to PROJECT_SPEC.md
3. **Note search and filtering** capabilities
4. **Import/export features** for markdown files
5. **Performance monitoring** and optimization

## Session End Checklist

Before ending any development session:
- All code committed with proper messages
- Tests written and passing
- PR created if feature complete
- Next steps documented

## File Organization

### CLAUDE.md (This File)
- Current project state and progress
- Session goals and accomplishments
- Permission rules and technical decisions
- Next session priorities

### Always-Loaded Context Files
- **CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md** - Development workflows and standards
- **PROJECT_SPEC.md** - Architecture and technical requirements

### On-Demand Context Files
- **CODE_REFERENCE.md** - Code navigation and implementation details
- **CLAUDE_ARCHIVE.md** - Historical session summaries for reference

**Current Status**: The Chrome extension is production-ready with comprehensive features including text selection capture, highlighting, and security hardening. Ready to focus on backend API development and automated testing.
