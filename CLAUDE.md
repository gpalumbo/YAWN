# Project State and Claude Session Rules

## ðŸ”„ IMPORTANT SESSION START PROTOCOL
**When reading CLAUDE.md, always immediately read these companion files:**
1. **CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md** - Development workflows, testing procedures, and coding standards
2. **PROJECT_SPEC.md** - Project architecture, technology stack, and feature requirements
3. **INDEX.md** - Code navigation, file structure, and implementation reference

This ensures complete context for the current session and maintains consistency across all development work.

## Current Project State

### Completed Components
- âœ… **Chrome Extension Production-Ready** (2024-09-22)
    - Location: `chrome-extension/`
    - Features: Context menu integration, popup interface, local storage, security hardening
    - Status: Complete with security fixes, PR #3 (`feature/security-and-error-handling-fixes`)
    - Manual testing: Fully functional with comprehensive error handling
    - Documentation: Complete with INDEX.md for code navigation

### Architecture Foundation
- âœ… Project specification defined (PROJECT_SPEC.md)
- âœ… Git workflow and standards established
- âœ… Chrome extension manifest v3 structure
- ðŸ”„ Backend API not started
- ðŸ”„ Database schema not implemented
- ðŸ”„ Cloud deployment not configured

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Chrome Extension**: Manifest v3, SVG icons, service worker + popup architecture
- **Permissions**: activeTab, storage, scripting, contextMenus
- **Security**: Content Security Policy, XSS prevention, comprehensive error handling
- **UX**: Context menu integration, user-friendly error messages
- **Styling**: Gradient theme matching project branding
- **Storage**: Chrome local storage with usage analytics
- **Documentation**: INDEX.md for comprehensive code navigation

### Remaining Technical Debt
- No automated tests for extension (manual testing only)
- Icons are basic SVG placeholders (functional but could be improved)
- No build process or bundling (not needed for current scope)
- Code duplication between background.js and popup.js (noted in INDEX.md)

## Latest Session Summary (2024-09-23)

### Major Accomplishments
1. **Documentation Refactoring** - Reorganized docs with clear separation of concerns (CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md, PROJECT_SPEC.md, INDEX.md)
2. **JavaScript/HTML Formatting** - Added comprehensive Prettier and ESLint configuration
3. **DevOps Integration** - Updated pre-commit hooks and Makefile for full-stack linting/formatting
4. **Source Control Management** - Proper .gitignore rules for node_modules/ and JavaScript artifacts
5. **Cross-Platform Tooling** - Consistent formatting/linting for both Python and JavaScript codebases
6. **Console-Friendly Linting** - ESLint configured to ignore console statements as requested

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `CLAUDE.md` - NEW: Session state tracking and project rules hub
- `package.json` - NEW: Node.js dependencies and JavaScript tooling scripts
- `.eslintrc.json` - NEW: JavaScript linting configuration (console warnings disabled)
- `.prettierrc` - NEW: JavaScript/HTML/JSON formatting configuration
- `.eslintignore/.prettierignore` - NEW: Tool-specific exclusion patterns
- `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` - REFACTORED: Development workflows and testing procedures
- `PROJECT_SPEC.md` - STREAMLINED: Pure architecture specification
- `INDEX.md` - FOCUSED: Code navigation and reference only
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - UPDATED: Added JavaScript formatting/linting hooks
- `Makefile` - ENHANCED: Added comprehensive JavaScript tooling commands
- `.gitignore` - UPDATED: Added Node.js exclusions
- All `chrome-extension/*.{js,html,json}` - AUTO-FORMATTED: Consistent code style

### Documentation Organization
- âœ… Clear separation of concerns across documentation files
- âœ… Session start protocol for reading companion files
- âœ… Eliminated content duplication between files
- âœ… Cross-references between documentation files
- âœ… Improved maintainability for future sessions

### DevOps & Tooling Improvements
- âœ… Comprehensive JavaScript/HTML formatting pipeline
- âœ… Automated code quality checks for all file types
- âœ… Cross-platform development workflow support
- âœ… Pre-commit hooks prevent inconsistent code from being committed
- âœ… Make commands for unified development experience
- âœ… Proper dependency management (node_modules/ excluded from git)

### Code Quality & Standards
- âœ… Consistent formatting across Python and JavaScript codebases
- âœ… ESLint configured for Chrome extension environment
- âœ… Prettier configured with project-specific overrides
- âœ… Console statements preserved (no linting warnings)
- âœ… Automated formatting on commit via pre-commit hooks
