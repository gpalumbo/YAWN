2. **Registration Fee**: One-time $5 USD payment to register as a Chrome Web Store developer

### 3. Package Contents
The generated package includes:
- `manifest.json` (with PNG icon references)
- All JavaScript files (`background.js`, `content.js`, etc.)
- `popup.html`
- PNG icons (`16.png`, `48.png`, `128.png`)
- `libs/` directory with dependencies

**Excluded from package**:
- `test-*.html` files
