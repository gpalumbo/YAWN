2. **Off-Canvas Handle System & Replacement** - Built and then replaced complex handle system with simpler 50px visibility approach
3. **Critical Bug Fixes** - Resolved scroll repositioning, cache key construction, and undefined variable issues
4. **Performance Optimization** - Batched storage operations and replaced magic numbers with named constants
5. **Production-Ready PR** - Created PR #7 with comprehensive feature implementation and bug fixes

### Technical Implementation Highlights - Session 3
- **Offset Storage System**: Notes track `offsetX` and `offsetY` from anchor elements with Chrome storage persistence
- **Drag & Drop Functionality**: Full dragging with real-time updates, visual feedback, and automatic offset calculation
- **Window Resize Handling**: Debounced repositioning maintains anchor relationships across screen size changes
- **Visibility Management**: Page-boundary-based repositioning ensures 50px minimum visibility without scroll interference
- **Storage Optimization**: Batched async operations eliminate N storage calls and race conditions
- **Code Quality**: Named timing constants replace all magic numbers for better maintainability

### Critical Issues Resolved - Session 3
- **Scroll Repositioning Bug**: Fixed notes moving during normal scrolling by removing viewport-based visibility logic
- **Cache Key Construction**: Resolved `"undefined-undefined"` cache keys causing collisions
- **Runtime Errors**: Eliminated `offCanvasHandles` ReferenceError from stale variable references
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Replaced forEach storage loops with single batched operations
- **Magic Numbers**: Complete replacement with documented `TIMING` constants

### Pull Request Status - Session 3
